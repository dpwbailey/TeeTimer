--> delete all entries after they are exported from garmin

NOTES:

assume a standard hole completion time of duration/18 if specific hole times are not given
(depending on par of hole)

minimum interval between groups depending on the par of the first hole (higher for par 3,5 and lower for par 4)

alternative play formats (aggregate, alternating, etc)

if there is no csv file, they are a new player, and thus going to play significantly slower

golfnow

available: starting time, walking/riding, 9/18, front 9 or back 9 faster?, shotgun to track individual holes,
assume 2 people playing together will be slightly faster than the slower player

things that would be good to determine regarding their pace of play:
gender, preferred tee time, handicap playability,


important: how can we use the customer data to extrapolate additional information regarding their pace of play
